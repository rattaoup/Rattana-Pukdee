### About me
Hi, My name is Rattana Pukdee. I'm from Bangkok, Thailand. I've just finished my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/). Currently, I'm a research intern at the [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Mondelli](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/mondelli-group/), working on theoretical aspect of Neural Network Pruning. From March 2021, I will be a research assistant at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) with Prof. [Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html) and will work on Variational Unlearning. <br>

I'm generally interested in understanding tools in machine learning using Mathematics and Statistics, in particular, Deep Neural Networks. Also, I'm interested in robustness and generalisation of machine learning models. <br>
