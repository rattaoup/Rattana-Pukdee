# About me ðŸ§‘
My name is Rattana Pukdee.
I am an incoming PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie in the area of robust and safe machine learning and applications to promote social good. <br>

I graduated with a Master in Mathematics from the University of Oxford (4-year program) in 2020. I am grateful to the following people for hosting and mentoring me during research visits over the years: Prof. [Marco Mondelli](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/mondelli-group/), Prof. [Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html).
