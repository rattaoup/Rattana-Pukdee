# About me üñê
My name is Rattana Pukdee. I am an incoming PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie in the area of robust and safe machine learning and applications to promote social good. <br>

Previously, I obtained a (4-year integrated) master degree in Mathematics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/). <br>
